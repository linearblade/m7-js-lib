# AI Disclosure Statement

This project uses AI tooling in a supporting engineering role.

AI assistance was used to accelerate repetitive drafting, improve documentation consistency, and assist with targeted review workflows.

## Human Ownership

Core architecture, design decisions, behavioral contracts, and final implementation choices are human-authored and human-approved.

AI output is treated as draft input and is reviewed before acceptance.

## Scope of AI Assistance

Typical use includes:

* drafting or refining technical prose
* surfacing possible edge-case risks during review
* accelerating repetitive documentation and formatting tasks

## Responsibility

Final code, documentation guarantees, and published behavior remain the responsibility of the project maintainer.
